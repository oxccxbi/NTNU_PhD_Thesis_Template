\noindent This thesis was typeset using \LaTeX \ and the \texttt{book} documentclass. Main text is contained within the dimension of 115 mm (width)/197.2 mm (length), where the horizontal (top:bottom) and vertical (left:right) margin ratios are 1:1. The width of the margin notes is 12 mm. Style of this thesis is inspired by Friedrich Wiemer's thesis \textit{Security Arguments and Tool-based Design of Block Ciphers} [\url{https://hss-opus.ub.rub.de/opus4/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/7044/file/diss.pdf}]. \\

\noindent Sebastian Kosch's \textit{Crimson} [\url{https://github.com/skosch/Crimson}] is set as the running text (11 pt) typeface. Matthew Carterâ€™s \textit{Charter} acts as the title (14.4 pt), section (10 pt), subsection (10 pt), and header (8 pt) typefaces. Hermann Zapf's \textit{Palatino} serves as the page (9 pt) typeface. Christian Robertson's \textit{Roboto} [\url{https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/roboto/}] is utilized for the figure caption (8 pt) typeface. Libertine Open Fonts Project's \textit{Linux Libertine} [\url{https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/linuxlibertine/}] and Linus Romer's \textit{Miama Nueva} [\url{https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/miamanueva/}] are used for math/equation (11 pt) and calligraphical (14.4 pt) typefaces. The \texttt{textgreek} package [\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/textgreek}] provides Greek letters in normal font (being not \textit{italicized} as in \texttt{\$math\$} mode). \\
